Project Title: Simple Calculator

Day 5: Simple Calculator

Description: The Simple Calculator is a user-friendly web application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. With a clean interface and intuitive functionality, this tool allows users to input numbers and view results seamlessly.

Functionalities:

Input Numbers: Users can enter two numerical values for calculation.

Basic Operations: The calculator supports four fundamental arithmetic operations:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (−)
Multiplication (×)
Division (÷)

Display Results: The application shows the result of the selected operation in real-time.


Clear Input: A clear button allows users to reset the inputs and results, providing a fresh start for new calculations.

This project marks my fifth completion in the 30 Days of 30 Projects challenge, part of the Governor IT Program aimed at enhancing practical coding skills. Throughout this project, I enhanced my understanding of React, state management, and user interface design, creating a simple yet effective tool for everyday arithmetic tasks.
